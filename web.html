    <p>Web development is a broad field that focuses on building and maintaining websites. It typically involves three key technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. HTML is used to structure the content of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS is responsible for the visual presentation, allowing developers to style text, layout pages, and make websites responsive across different devices. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling dynamic content changes, form validation, and the integration of external APIs. Mastering these technologies involves understanding concepts like semantic HTML, Flexbox and Grid for responsive design, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Additionally, using version control tools like Git and GitHub is essential for managing code changes and collaboration. As you progress, building projects like a portfolio website or a simple weather app can solidify your skills. With these foundations, you can dive deeper into advanced frameworks and tools to create more complex web applications.</p>
